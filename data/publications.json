    "abstract": "Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning, and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from different data types), alignment methods (to match information across modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).",
    "zhAbstract": "多模态学习是人工智能领域快速发展的方向，通过融合图像、文本和音频等多种信息源帮助机器理解复杂内容。利用各模态的优势，多模态学习使AI系统能够构建更强大、更丰富的内部表示，从而改善机器的解释、推理和决策能力。该领域包括表示学习、对齐方法和融合策略等核心技术。"
